## Advantages of Machine Translation

- Fast
- Comparatively cheap
- Confidential

## Approaches for machine translation

- Direct translation:  
  More or less word-for-word translation. This approach works well
  for closely related languages.

- Interlingua:  
  Involves converting from the source language to some abstract intermediate
  representation. Then the text is generated in the target language from the interlingua.

## Methods

- Rule based:  
  Here, we attempt to use well defined linguistic rules for transforming text from one language to another.
  
- Corpus based:  
  Using parallel corpa, we simply map relevant parts of a text translated between two languages,
  and use statistical methods to find connections between the elements and structure of the two languages.
