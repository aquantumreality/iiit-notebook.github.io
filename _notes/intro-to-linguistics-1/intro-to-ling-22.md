# Information coding 
Languages may differ in how much information is coded at different levels
Morphology and syntax
English has a fixed word order, meaning of the overall sentences generally changes if you change the word order. 
for example:
"The police caught the thief."
v/s
"The thief caught the police."

English has a lot of vacuous or placeholder elements:
"_It_ is raining" 
what is "it"?

or "_There_ is a rose in my garden"
and so on.

Consider Hindi / or most other Indian languages 
"Police ne chor ko pakda"
v/s
"chor ko police ne pakda"

Notice that there is word order flexibility here. Also notice that we have to move "ko" with "chor" and "ne" with "police" to keep the information same.
Hindi has a more rich and complex morphology. 


## Syntax
Speakers' knowledge of sentences and their structure. 

### Rules of syntax
The native speaker has knowledge of this (implicitly)
- Combine words  →  phrase → sentences
- Specify the correct word order for a given language:
    - "The SC has given order to form a committee"
    - Sybject → verb → object
    - \**SC the a committee form has orders given* (this is not okay)
    - "Sc ne committee banane ke liye aadesh diye"
    - Subject → object → verb (default)
    - but Indian languages are flexible with word order. 
 - Specify the grammatical relations of a S-Sub, o
 - Specifies the constraints on the subject based on the verb:
     - \*_Rekha laughed the audience_ This should be wrong because "laughed" doesn't need an object.
     - _Rekha laughed_ is good
     - \*Savitribai Phule founded (makes no sense)
     - \*Savitribai Phule founded schools for girls
     - (object need)
     - Note: transitive verbs need an object, intransitive verbs don't.
- Syntactic rules


## Grammaticality is not based on
1. Memory: we can judge the grammaticality of sentences we've never heard before. 
2. Meaningfulness: syntax seems to be independent of meaning.


## Sentence structure
not a mere linear concatenation of words
consider:
"The cat drank the milk"
   |      |      |       |      |
Det   N    v      Det N
\[The cat\] \[drank the milk\]
\[The cat\] \[drank \[the milk\]\]

### Tests for constituency
__Standalone test__
__Replacement by a pronoun__
__Moves as a unit__

## Syntactic Categories

"Sulu has missed the bus"
can become "My elder brother has missed the bus"
therefore "Sulu" and "My elder brother" can be interchanged without losing grammaticality.

Sulu                                         has missed the bus  
My elder brother                     has missed the bus  
The PM                                   has missed the bus  

The left side falls in the category of words called: __Noun phrase__(NP)

Sulu     missed      the train.
Sulu     caught      the train.
Sulu     boarded   the train.
Sulu     rode         the train.
Sulu     sketched  the train

As you can see, the verbs are interchangable (in terms of grammaticality)
A __verb phrase__ needs a verb and can have other optional constituents like say an NP
