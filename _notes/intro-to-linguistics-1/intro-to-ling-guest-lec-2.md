## Grammatical Theories (differences)

| **Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG)**              | **Dependency Grammar (DG)**             |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| - Preserves the structural representation       | - Does not preserve the structure       |
| of the sentence inherently                      | of the sentence                         |
| - It allows for recursion, similar embedded     | - Captures more of the semantic meaning |
| clauses can be nested within the tree           | and relations between nodes             |
| - It is a context-free approach, meaning        | - Is it context-sensitive??             |
| that elements surrounding a set of elements     |                                         |
| to be decided do not affect the decision itself |                                         |

## Tree structures (differences)

| **Constituent Tree**              | **Dependency Tree**          |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| - Abstract nodes                  | - Lexical nodes              |
| - Order matters                   | - Order not captured         |
| - Undirected graph with no labels | - Directed graph with labels |

## Paninian Grammatical Traddition
This grammatical perspective looks at relations between words, and is thus similar to Dependency Grammar.

- Treats a sentence as a series of modifier-modified relations
- Every sentence has a primary modified ('root', generally verb)
- Relations between verbs and their direct participants called *'karaka'**
- Other relations - such as reason, prupose, genitive etc
- The relations are expressed through explicit markers called *'vibhakti'*

### Realization of *karaka*: *vibhakti* (relation markers)
