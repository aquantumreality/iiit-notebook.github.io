## Phones and Phonemes
A **phone** is a minimal unit of sound, which can be phonetically atomised into features. For e.g. the phone [b] can be decomposed to its characteristic features: voiced, bilabial, plosive.  
 A **phoneme** on the other hand is a 'psychological reality'. They represent the perceived organisation of the actual phones by a listener.

Phones are absolute and untied to a language. Phonemes however are distinct only with reference to a language. For e.g. consider the phones [p] and [ph]:  
In English, the aspiration does not distinguish these two as phonemes in the language, since pen [phen] *(with aspiration)* and pen [pen] *(without aspiration)* are examples of two equivalent pronunciations for the word.  
However, in Hindi, the presence of this aspiration can change the meaning of the word, for example 'पल' [pəl] and 'फल' [phəl].
This means that in Hindi, [p] and [ph] are two distinct phonemes.

Multiple phones which can be used to pronounce the same phoneme in the language are called **allophones**.

## Contrastive and Complementary Distribution
Two phones are said to be in **contrastive distribution** if changing one to the other results in a change in the meaning, i.e if the two phones are distinct phonemes in the language.

Two phones are said to be in **complementary distribution** if they are not distinct phonemes in the language, but the phones are not used interchangably; the phonetic context decides which phone is used.  
In English, for e.g. [p] and [ph] are in complementary distribution, we use the aspirated [ph] sound when the /p/ phoneme is present at the beginning of an stressed syllable, such as in 'part' [phaɹt]. In other situations, we use the [p] sound, such as in 'sipping' [sippiŋ]
