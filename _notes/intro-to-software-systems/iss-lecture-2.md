### Requirements for basic computing device
- Input and Output unit
- Memory unit (primary, and secondary)
- Processing unit (ALU, CU, registers)
- Interconnection structure (control, address & data buses)

## Software
A set of programs, procedures, algorithms and its documentation (lol).
In order to write software, we use programming languages which operate at different levels

### Programming language
They represent computational instructions as a language, with its own syntactic and semantic rules.
They often come with their own methods to allow different ways to express the computation and have
safeguards like memory management, error handling etc.

- **Interpreted languages**: eg: python, bash
- **Compiled languages**: eg: C, C++
[Differences between compiled and interpreted languages](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=zos-compiled-versus-interpreted-languages)

## Memory
Memory is a key aspect of the hardware, and along with the processor, largely decides the computational
power of the system.

When we boot up a computer system, we must first run the bootstrap
